## ERD 
- [ERD with dbdiagram](https://dbdiagram.io/d/63857f39c9abfc611175c8fc)
- [mockaroo faux data](https://www.mockaroo.com/d6d30cd0)
Premises of the assumptions for the relationship between vocab words data and Language/Tech data: 
- that a Language/Tech can have many words
- and a vocabulary word can only have one Langauge/Tech

## Get Started 
- You can clone it and start editing here

`$ git clone git@github.com:AngieMGonzalez/INDIVIDUAL-ASSESSMENT-vocab-YOU-lary.git` 

`$ cd INDIVIDUAL-ASSESSMENT-vocab-YOU-lary`

## About the User
- The ideal user for this application is a begginning coder
- They would like to keep track of new terms/words/vocabulary of coding languages with definitions of each of the words
- The problem this app solves for them is it allows them to start creating flash cards of vocabulary words and quickly filter each term by the language type/technology that that word refers to

## Features 
- When a new vocabulary word is added, an object should be created and that object should be pushed into the firebase API and a new card of that vocab word prints to the DOM.
- Filters: There is a required langauge/technology type when creating a new word and you can filter each different list of language/technology words through the buttons in the navigation bar
- Vocabulary Word Editing: You can edit and recatagorize each word and you can delete each word
